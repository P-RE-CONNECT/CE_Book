# Construction Mechanics 1

Welcome to the **Construction Mechanics 1 (CM1)** section of the P-RE-CONNECT Civil Engineering TeachBook. CM1 is the foundation of the Construction Mechanics course chain and introduces you to the basic principles of structural analysis, including equilibrium, internal forces, and simple structures.

In this section, you will find:

- An explanation of the **{ref}`prior knowledge <content:cm1:pre_reqs>`** you are expected to have before starting CM1,
- A **{ref}`small summary <content:cm1:summary>`** of the course and its concepts,
- A **{ref}`diagnostic test <content:cm1:diag_test>`** to help you identify which topics you have already mastered and which might need more attention,
- And a selection of **{ref}`targeted practice exercises <content:cm1:prac_exs>`** to help you prepare for the exam or build a stronger foundation for future courses such as CM2 and CM3.

Whether you're taking CM1 for the first time, preparing for a resit, or reviewing key concepts before continuing to CM2 or CM3, this section is designed to guide your learning step by step and help you gain confidence in the core principles of construction mechanics.
