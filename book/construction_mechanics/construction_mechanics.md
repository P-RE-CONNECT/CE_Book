# Introduction

Welcome to the Construction Mechanics course chain page of this *P-RE-CONNECT Civil Engineering* TeachBook. Each course in this chain (**Construction Mechanics 1, 2, and 3**) builds upon the knowledge and skills of its predecessor. To help you navigate these connections effectively, each course has its own dedicated section where:

* **the prerequisites** of the course are explained,
* a **short summary** of the course is provided,
* a **diagnostic test** is available to help you quickly assess your understanding of key concepts,
* and **practice exercises** are included to help you prepare for your exam.

This structure is designed to give you a clear overview of what is expected, allow you to reflect on your prior knowledge, and support you in studying both smarter and more efficiently, whether youâ€™re preparing for a first attempt, a resit, or a follow-up course. By using this book, you can strengthen your foundation and increase your confidence throughout the entire Construction Mechanics learning line.
